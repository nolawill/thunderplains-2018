        <p>Learning web development from scratch can be a daunting task. In addition to programming languages, there are all kinds of tools it seems you need to master just to get started: bundlers, taskrunners, package managers, transpilers&hellip; when and how did web development get to be so complicated? In this talk, we'll follow the evolution of a web page through time, introducing it to technical obstacles and innovations until we arrive at present day. We'll come away with a better appreciation for the problems our modern tools solve, and historical context for how the field has evolved.</p>

        <p>As a developer a certain set of skills, habits, and tools are needed to ship "secure" software. Set to the theme of the Oregon trail, this talk takes you down the developer trail, equipping you with new tools, making sure your team has built the right skills, and overcoming unknown challenges. Will you catch a virus from a 3rd party dependency, narrowly escape peer review, or make it to production unscathed? Find yourself on the developer trail.</p>

        <p>Intermittent internet connection is something many people in the United States face, and it’s a huge hurdle to complete simple tasks like finding a bank balance – or even more important tasks like searching for employment.</p>

    <p>Service workers can help by caching assets like HTML pages, images and even JavaScript files within the user’s browser. Once the assets are cached, the browser will load directly from the cache making the entire loading process faster. Even better, because the assets are already in the browser, the page will load without an Internet connection!</p>

    <p>This talk will introduce service workers, explore use cases, and teach the audience how to implement service workers in their apps. We’ll also learn about other great features of service workers like background sync and push notifications.</p>
